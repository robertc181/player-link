# Player Link

Player Link is an online platform that will link football players with scouts, So that scouts can watch a football player and find out when they will be playing there next football games and more information about said player, such as current team , position , preffered foot etc. This platform will also allow a player to view which scouts are watching them and which scouts will be going to thier games. A player will be able to create an account with Player Link and put up information about themselves, they can also create an event which they can set a time place and name. If a scout has started scouting a player on Player Link they will be allowed to view a players events and click on the ones that they wish to go to. 

A scout can also sign up with Player Link to find talented footballers and get more information about them and there football games. They will have a profile where they can search for players and view all players profiles they have scouted on Player Link and view all the events they have opted to go to.
