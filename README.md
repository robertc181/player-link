# Player Link

Player Link is an online platform that will link football players with scouts, So that scouts can watch a football player and find out when they will be playing there next football games and more information about that player, such as current team , position , preffered foot etc. This platform will also allow a player to view which scouts are watching them and which scouts will be going to thier games. A player will be able to create an account with Player Link and put up information about themselves, they can also create an event which they can set a time place and name. If a scout has started scouting a player on Player Link they will be allowed to view a players events and click on the ones that they wish to go to. 

A scout can also sign up with Player Link to find talented footballers and get more information about them and there football games. They will have a profile where they can search for players and view all players profiles they have scouted on Player Link and view all the events they have opted to go to.  

## UX

1. App Goals
    
    My objective with Player Link is to firstly allow scouts who are struggling to find players around thier area to scout and help them connect with players and hopefull come accross some talent, Player Link allows a scout to search for a players name then click to view that players profile, The scout can then click to scout that player and now he can view thier events, A scout can click to attend an event such as a game or tournament which will notify the player that the scout is going to thier event. As a player this allows many player with a chance to connect with more scouts and hopefully get a better chance to showcase thier talent and invite more scouts to thier games
